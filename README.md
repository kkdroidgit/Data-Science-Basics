# Data-Science-Basics

## Python Libraries

Following are the most common Python libraries:

* **Numpy** is a library for working with arrays of data.

* **Scipy** is a library of techniques for numerical and scientific computing.

* **Matplotlib** is a library for making visualizations.

* **Seaborn** is a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can be used to simplify many visualization tasks.

### NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

We will focus on the numpy array object.

#### Numpy Array

A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension. 

### SciPy

Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays. SciPy builds on this, and provides a large number of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.

For this course, we will primariyl be using the **SciPy.Stats** sub-library.

#### SciPy.Stats

The SciPy.Stats module contains a large number of probability distributions as well as a growing library of statistical functions such as:

* Continuous and Discrete Distributions (i.e Normal, Uniform, Binomail, etc.)

* Descriptive Statistcs

* Statistical Tests (i.e T-Test)


### MatPlotLib

Matplotlib is a plotting library. In this section give a brief introduction to the matplotlib.pyplot module.

### Seaborn

Seaborn is complimentary to Matplotlib and it specifically targets statistical data visualization. But it goes even further than that: Seaborn extends Matplotlib and makes generating visualizations convenient.

While Matplotlib is a robust solution for various problems, Seaborn utilizes more concise paramesters for ease-of-use.

#### Scatterplots

A scatterplot is a type of data display that shows the relationship between two numerical variables. Each member of the dataset gets plotted as a point whose x-y coordinates relates to its values for the two variables.
